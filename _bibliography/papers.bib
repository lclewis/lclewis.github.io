We also introduce a novel gradient descent algorithm for this scenario adopting a combination of large and small learning rates, and provide convergence guarantees.},

@article{liu2023linear,
	abstract = {We study linear regression applied to data structured on a manifold. We reveal the impact of the data manifold's extrinsic geometry on the regression by deriving explicit solution formulas and numerical experiments. Our findings reveal the role of data manifold geometry in ensuring the stability of regression models for out-of-distribution inferences.},
