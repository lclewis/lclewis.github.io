@article{he2024data,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of multiscale data on machine learning algorithms. A dataset is multiscale if its distribution shows large variations in scale across different directions. This paper reveals multiscale structures in the loss landscape, and introduces a novel gradient descent algorithm that uses a combination of large and small learning rates. This approach seeks to transcend empirical learning rate selection, and offering it a more systematic, data-informed strategy.},

@article{liu2023linear,
	abstract = {We study linear regression applied to data structured on a manifold. We reveal the impact of the data manifold's extrinsic geometry on the regression by deriving explicit solution formulas and numerical experiments. Our findings reveal the role of data manifold geometry in ensuring the stability of regression models for out-of-distribution inferences.},
