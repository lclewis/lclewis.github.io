# My own navigation notes

### Header:
there are many headers and pages (cv, dropdown, projects, repositories, etc.) that are currently hidden. To enable them, simply go to '_pages' and set the nav value to be `true` for corresponding pages.

### CV:

the current CV content (if enabled) is loading data from 'assets/json/resume.json'. Modify the content there. Or simply add your own cv data to 'jekyll_get_json' inside `_config.yml`. (If no data is given, it loads the stuff inside `cv.yml` file)
