Hello! I can also go by Lewis. I'm a fourth-year Ph.D.candidate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm grateful for working with and being supported by Prof.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ytsai/">Richard Tsai</a> under the <a target="_blank" href="https://tsairesearch.github.io">Scientific AI Research group</a>.

My research interests primarily center around studying the impact of the geometry of the  data distribution on (machine learning) algorithms, through the applications of tools from differential geometry and geometric probability.



I'm also into cooking, British rock, bouldering, escape room, and Hearthstone.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
